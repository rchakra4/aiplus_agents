# AI Foundations: Working with LLMs and Tools

## Summary

This introductory workshop provides fundamental concepts and techniques for working with Large Language Models (LLMs), with a focus on the OpenAI API. You'll learn essential patterns that apply across different LLM providers and build a foundation for agentic AI applications.

## Workshop Structure

### AI Foundations (`1_1_ai_foundations.ipynb`)

Master the core concepts of LLM interaction:

1. **Basic API Operations**

   - Setting up the OpenAI client and environment
   - Making chat completion requests with GPT-4o
   - Understanding API response structures
   - Structuring JSON output formats

2. **Tool Integration**

   - Building custom tools (e.g., stock price lookup)
   - Creating and managing tool definitions
   - Handling tool calls and responses
   - Implementing conversational flows with tools

3. **Advanced Prompting**
   - Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting
   - One-shot / few-shot learning examples
   - Structured financial analysis prompts
   - Response parsing and formatting

## Required Packages

- **openai**: OpenAI API interaction
- **python-dotenv** and **getpass**: Environment variable management

## Key Features

- JSON-structured output handling
- Interactive conversation loops
- Tool-augmented responses
- Structured thinking patterns
- Response parsing techniques

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python knowledge
- Understanding of API concepts
- OpenAI API key

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Configure your OpenAI API key
