# 2. Agents

## Summary

This session expands on the foundations of AI applications, transforming basic chat interactions to simple agentic workflows. You will learn how to build AI agents capable of reflection, tool use, memory, planning, and taking action to solve complex tasks.

## Workshop Structure

### 1. LangChain Foundations (`2_1_langchain_foundations.ipynb`)

Learn the essential building blocks of LangChain:

- Model initialization and configuration
- Working with messages and prompts
- Building and combining chains
- Output parsing and structured responses
- Memory management fundamentals

### 2. Pre-built ReAct Agents (`2_2_prebuilt_react_agents.ipynb`)

Explore ready-to-use agent architectures:

- Understanding the ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) pattern
- Implementing agents with built-in tools
- Working with web search capabilities
- Managing agent memory and conversation history
- Handling agent outputs and errors

### 3. Custom Graph Agents (`2_3_custom_graph_agents.ipynb`)

Build more sophisticated / custom agent workflows:

- Expanding on custom agent architectures using LangGraph
- Visualizing the graph using IPython display

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Python and Jupyter notebooks
- Familiarity with LLMs and API usage
- OpenAI, Langchain, Tavily API keys configured in your environment

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Configure your API keys
3. Start with `2_1_langchain_foundations.ipynb` and progress through the notebooks in order
4. Upload notebooks to Google colab or open locally (install dependencies in a virtual environment if running locally)
